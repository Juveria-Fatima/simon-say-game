Simon Says Game is an interactive browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests memory and concentration by generating a sequence of colors that the player must repeat in the correct order. With each level, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic implementation, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.
